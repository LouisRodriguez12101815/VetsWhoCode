# My Introductory Web Project

I have limited exposure to programming. 
Most of my experience with tech has been through my courses for my degree in cloud (formally AS in Enterprise Network Technology at ENTech at Miami Dade College)
I have also had some projects, I have used for background on Networking ( scripts for Raspberry Pi Zero, Flipper Zero, creating resources on AWS)
I have also some background in jobs I have held ( working at repair shop, data entry for a bulk sms company, compliance for an aws parnter)
I am excited to learn about websites and look forward to applying what I know for SEO and hopefully getting a raise at work because of it.

## Project Structure

- `boilerplate.html`: The main HTML document.
- `boilerplate.css`: Contains all the styling rules for the website.
- `boilerplate.js`: Includes JavaScript for interactive functionality.
